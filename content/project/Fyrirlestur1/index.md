The continent of Antarctica, and particularly the South Pole, provides one of the best sites on earth for studying the cosmos with millimeter-wave telescopes. The high and dry site and extremely stable atmosphere enables idea conditions for year-round observations of the universe beyond our own galaxy. In this talk, I will give an overview of two instruments that have made use of these unique conditions to study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation left over from the Big Bang. The first is the SPIDER balloon-borne telescope, flown in 2015 and 2022, and designed to study the larger-scale features in the CMB to search for signatures of primordial gravitational waves. The second is the South Pole Telescope, commissioned in 2007 and currently housing its third generation camera SPT-3G, designed to study the smaller-scale features in the CMB along with a wide variety of compact and transient astrophysical phenomena. Together, these two instruments bring us closer to understanding the origin and evolution of our universe. I will also provide some insight into what it's like to live and work in such a unique and remote environment.
